  recipeIngredient: [
    "250g basmati rice, rinsed",
    "2 tsp vegetable oil",
    "4 garlic cloves, sliced",
    "1 red chilli, sliced",
    "20g ginger, finely chopped",
    "400g can coconut milk",
    "3 tbsp tamarind paste",
    "1kg mussels, washed and beards removed",
    "Small handful coriander leaves (optional)",
  ],
  recipeInstructions: [
    "Put the rice in a pan with 500ml cold water. Cover and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 7 minutes. Remove from the heat (keeping the lid on) and leave to steam for 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the oil, then add the garlic, chilli and ginger and cook over a medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute to release their flavour. Stir in the coconut milk, tamarind paste and 500ml water. Bring to the boil, then add the mussels, cover and simmer for about 8 minutes until all the mussels have opened, then taste and season (mussels can be salty so do taste first).",
    "Divide the rice among bowls, then serve the mussels on top, spooning over plenty of the broth. Sprinkle with the coriander, if using.",
